🎯 GitHub Issue Creation Solution Summary
=========================================

This implementation provides complete tooling to parse structured project tasks
and create properly formatted GitHub Issues according to the requirements from
issue #7 and the copilot-tasks specifications.

📁 Files Created:
- .github/create_issues_from_json.js    (Main implementation)
- .github/test_issue_creation.js        (Test suite)
- .github/workflows/create-issues.yml   (Fixed GitHub Actions workflow)

📋 Tasks Identified:
From .github/project_tasks.json:
  1. [Milestone 1: Setup] Timeline Project Initiation (Phase: Backlog)
  2. [Milestone 2: Core Endpoints] /v1/chat/completions (Phase: To Do)

From docs/project_tasks.json:
  3. [Planning Phase] Define project scope and requirements (Phase: Planning)  
  4. [Setup Phase] Initialize Cloudflare Worker project (Phase: Setup)

✅ Issue Format Compliance:
- Title: [Milestone N: <Milestone Name>] <Task Name>
- Body includes: Description, Success Criteria, Unit Tests, Phase
- Labels: copilot:task
- Proper comment section structure

🚀 Usage Options:

1. Automated via GitHub Actions:
   - Workflow triggers on changes to project_tasks.json files
   - Requires GITHUB_TOKEN permissions for issue creation

2. Manual via GitHub CLI:
   - Run: node .github/create_issues_from_json.js
   - Copy/paste the generated 'gh issue create' commands

3. Manual via GitHub UI:
   - Use the formatted output for manual issue creation

🧪 Testing:
   - Run: node .github/test_issue_creation.js
   - Validates all core functions and file parsing

📊 Current Status:
   - 4 structured tasks ready to be published as individual GitHub issues
   - All tools tested and working correctly
   - GitHub Actions workflow configured and ready

Next Steps:
1. Run the issue creation script to see the output
2. Execute the GitHub CLI commands to create the issues
3. Or use the GitHub Actions workflow for automated creation

✨ This completes the "Publishing remaining structured tasks as individual
   GitHub issues" requirement from PR #3.
